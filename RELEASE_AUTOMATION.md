# Release Automation Summary

I've created a comprehensive release automation system for the Peerless project. Here's what's been implemented:

## Files Created

### 1. `release.sh` - Main Release Script
A robust bash script that handles semver incrementing and goreleaser execution.

**Features:**
- 🔢 **Semver Support**: Automatically increments patch, minor, or major versions
- 🔒 **Safety Checks**: Ensures clean git working directory and proper branch
- 🎨 **Colored Output**: Easy-to-read status messages
- ⚠️ **Interactive Prompts**: Confirms actions before executing
- 🔄 **Git Integration**: Automatically fetches, tags, and pushes
- 📦 **Goreleaser Integration**: Runs `goreleaser release --clean`

**Usage:**
```bash
./release.sh patch   # 0.1.6 -> 0.1.7
./release.sh minor   # 0.1.6 -> 0.2.0
./release.sh major   # 0.1.6 -> 1.0.0
```

### 2. `Makefile` - Build Automation
Comprehensive Makefile with development, build, and release targets.

**Key Targets:**
- `make release-patch` - Create patch release
- `make release-minor` - Create minor release
- `make release-major` - Create major release
- `make dev` - Run linting and tests
- `make build` - Build binary for current platform
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make clean` - Clean artifacts

**Usage:**
```bash
make help          # Show all targets
make release-patch # Create patch release
make dev           # Development workflow
```

### 3. `test-release.sh` - Testing Script
Dry-run script to test the release process without actually releasing.

**Features:**
- Tests version calculation logic
- Checks git status and goreleaser availability
- Shows current version and available targets

**Usage:**
```bash
./test-release.sh
```

### 4. `RELEASE.md` - Documentation
Comprehensive documentation covering the entire release process.

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites and setup
- Step-by-step usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices
- Manual release process

### 5. `RELEASE_AUTOMATION.md` - This Summary
Overview of the complete release automation system.

## Release Workflow

### Before Release
1. ✅ Ensure git working directory is clean
2. ✅ Run tests and linting (`make dev`)
3. ✅ Be on main/master branch
4. ✅ Have goreleaser installed

### During Release (Interactive)
1. 🚀 Run `./release.sh patch` (or minor/major)
2. 📋 Script shows current and new version
3. 🤔 Confirm you want to proceed
4. 📤 Script creates and pushes git tag
5. 🏗️ Script runs `goreleaser release --clean`
6. 🎉 Release published to GitHub

### After Release
1. 📊 Check GitHub releases for artifacts
2. 📝 Update CHANGELOG.md if needed
3. 🐛 Fix any issues if release failed

## Safety Features

### Pre-flight Checks
- ✅ Clean git working directory required
- ✅ Main/master branch verification (with override)
- ✅ Goreleaser availability check
- ✅ Latest changes fetched from remote

### Interactive Prompts
- ❌ Confirmation required before proceeding
- ❌ Clear warning about what will happen
- ❌ Easy cancellation option

### Error Handling
- 🚫 Stops on any error
- 🚫 Provides helpful error messages
- 🚫 Git tag not created if goreleaser fails

## Version Examples

| Command    | From   | To     |
|------------|--------|--------|
| `patch`    | 0.1.6  | 0.1.7  |
| `minor`    | 0.1.6  | 0.2.0  |
| `major`    | 0.1.6  | 1.0.0  |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Make sure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for release"

# 2. Test the setup (optional)
./test-release.sh

# 3. Create a patch release
./release.sh patch

# Or use the Makefile
make release-patch
```

## Requirements

- **Go**: For building the application
- **Git**: For version control and tagging
- **Goreleaser**: For release automation (install from https://goreleaser.com/install/)
- **GitHub Token**: For publishing releases (set as `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable)

## Installation

```bash
# Make scripts executable (one-time setup)
chmod +x release.sh
chmod +x test-release.sh

# Install goreleaser (if not already installed)
curl -sSfL https://goreleaser.com/install.sh | sh
```

This automation system provides a safe, reliable, and easy-to-use way to create releases with proper semver versioning and goreleaser integration.
